# Weather Now

A modern, responsive weather application built with **React**, **Context API**, and **Axios**, inspired by the  
[Frontend Mentor – Weather App Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/weather-app-K1FhddVm49).

The app allows users to search for locations, view current weather conditions, and see hourly and daily forecasts with smooth loading states and error handling.

## Features

- Search locations with autocomplete
- Toggle temperature units
- Skeleton loading states
- No-results & API error handling
- Hourly & daily forecasts
- UI inspired by Frontend Mentor design

## Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite)
- **Context API + Reducer**
- **Axios**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Open-Meteo API** (weather data)
- **Geocoding API** (location search)

## State Management

- Global state handled using Context API + reducer
- API calls centralized in context

## Improvements Planned

- Optimized API calls
- Debounced search input
- API request cancellation
- Keyboard navigation for search
- Improved accessibility (ARIA)
- Better state enums
